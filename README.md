# 🗣️ Simple Voice/Speech Recognition Demo

This project is a **basic voice recognition system** built in Python (no AI or ML used).  
It records an audio clip from your microphone, compares it with preprocessed reference samples, and replies with the most likely response based on signal correlation.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🎙️ Records a 3-second audio sample using your microphone  
- 🔊 Preprocesses all `.wav` signals (DC offset removal, normalization, and noise gating)  
- 🧠 Compares your voice sample with all stored reference samples using **normalized cross-correlation**  
- 🗨️ Responds with a voice output using `pyttsx3`

## 📂 Project Structure

```
project/
│
├── Data/               # Original unprocessed .wav files provided by you
├── Preprocessed/       # Automatically generated by running dataset_processing.py (cleaned dataset)
│
├── dataset_processing.py  # Preprocesses all WAVs in /Data and saves to /Preprocessed
└── script.py              # Main recognition and response script
```

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy scipy pyaudio pyttsx3
  ```
- A working **microphone**
- A folder named `/Data` containing `.wav` audio files

---

## 🧩 Preparing the Dataset

1. Place all `.wav` files you want to use for comparison inside the `/Data` folder.  
2. Each file must be named using the following format:  
   ```
   {person name} - {phrase}.wav
   ```
   **Examples:**
   ```
   John - Hello.wav
   Mary - How are you.wav
   ```
3. Run the preprocessing script to clean and normalize all files:  
   ```bash
   python dataset_processing.py
   ```
   This will generate cleaned copies inside `/Preprocessed`.

---

## ▶️ Running the Voice Recognition Demo

Once preprocessing is complete, start the main application:
```bash
python script.py
```

---

## ❗ This Program Will

- Record a short 3-second audio sample  
- Compare it with all signals in `/Preprocessed`  
- Identify the most similar speaker and phrase  
- Speak the corresponding response aloud  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

**Preprocessing:**  
Removes DC offset, normalizes amplitude, and applies a noise gate to filter quiet background noise.  

**Matching:**  
Computes the maximum normalized cross-correlation between your recorded sample and each preprocessed reference.  

**Decision:**  
Chooses the (speaker, phrase) pair with the highest similarity score.  

**Response:**  
Uses `pyttsx3` to generate a spoken reply.

## 🔳 Example Output

```bash
Listening for an audio phrase...
Recording complete.
Loading: Preprocessed/John - Hello.wav
Loading: Preprocessed/Mary - How are you.wav
Detected: ('John', 'Hello') (score: 0.94)
Response: Hey! John
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Support for more phrases and responses  
- Add speaker authentication or confidence thresholds  
- Integrate MFCCs or deep learning for better accuracy  
- Noise reduction and silence trimming
